# Release v1.0.0 - Initial Microservices Gateway + User Service

## 🚀 Features

- **Microservices Architecture**

  - Implemented modular GraphQL gateway with authentication and routing
  - Developed user service with comprehensive CRUD operations
  - Introduced `@public` directive for public API access

- **Security Enhancements**

  - Implemented JWT authentication
  - Added nonce validation to prevent replay attacks
  - Developed strict CORS protection with origin validation

- **Performance Optimizations**
  - Integrated in-memory caching mechanism
  - Implemented scheduled cache management
  - Optimized for serverless execution on Cloudflare Workers

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

- **Gateway**
